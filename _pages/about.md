## Academic Background

- ***Sept 2021 â€” Jun 2025***: Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)

## Research Interests

- ***Multi-Modal Machine Learning (MMML)***

  Humans perceive the world through various sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, and tactile senses. Multi-Modal Machine Learning (MMML) research addresses machine learning problems with different modalities of data. Common modalities include vision, text, and sound. They usually come from different sensors, and the formation of data and internal structure differ significantly. For example, images are a continuous space that naturally exists in the world, while text is a discrete space organized by human knowledge and grammar rules. The heterogeneity of multimodal data poses challenges for learning the correlations and complementarities among them.

- ***Few-Shot Learning (FSL)***

  Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning method that trains with limited information datasets. The common practice in machine learning application fields is to provide models with as much data as possible. This is because in most machine learning applications, providing more data helps the model in making better predictions. However, few-shot learning aims to construct accurate machine learning models with fewer training data. Since the dimensionality of input data determines the cost of resources (such as time cost, computational cost, etc.), people can lower the cost of data analysis/machine learning (ML) by using few-shot learning.

- ***Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)***

  In recent years, there have been many large pre-trained models in deep learning research, such as GPT-3, BERT, ViT, etc., which can achieve excellent performance in various natural language and even visual image processing tasks. However, the training cost of these large pre-trained models is very high, requiring a huge amount of computational resources and data. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique aims to improve the performance of pre-trained models on new tasks by minimizing the number of fine-tuning parameters and computational complexity, thus easing the training cost of large pre-trained models and achieving efficient transfer learning.
